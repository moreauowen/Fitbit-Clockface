# Fitbit-Clockface
This is a basic FitbitOS clockface using Fitbit SDK. The goal of this mini project was to gain a base-level understanding of Javascript, CSS, and SVG. Now that I understand these technologies, I can start working towards more robust front-end projects in the future. Questions or concerns - contact moreauowen@gmail.com.

Want to wear this clockface on your Fitbit Versa devices?
